# cs697_term_project_phaseI

In this repository, you will find the crater dataset and a sample neural network that initialy designed to recognize handwritten digits. 

The following shows the general steps for doing the phase I of this project, you can find more information about each step on project description file (cs697-term project-phaseI.pdf). 

a.	Download the dataset in zip format. You can find it in crater_dataset folder. 

b.	Extract the dataset. 

c.	Install the OpenCV library.  

d.	Preprocess the dataset images.

e.	Develop your own Neural Network Model.

f.	Train the model.

g.	Extract the results.

h.	Analysis the results and write the report.
